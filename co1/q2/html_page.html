        <h2 style="color: beige;">POP SINGER JIMIN</h2>
        <p>Park Ji-min (Korean: 박지민; born October 13, 1995), better known mononymously as Jimin, is a South Korean singer, songwriter, and dancer. In 2013, he debuted as a member of the South Korean boy band BTS, under the record label Big Hit Entertainment.On June 13, 2013, Jimin made his debut as a member of BTS with the release of the single "No More Dream".[7] In the group, Jimin holds the position of vocalist and dancer. Under BTS, he has released three solo songs: "Lie", "Serendipity", and "Filter". The first was released in 2016 as part of the band's second Korean studio album, Wings. It was described as stunning and dramatic, conveying dark undertones and emotions that helped reflect the overall concept of the album.[8] In contrast, the second song, released on the Love Yourself: Her (2017) extended play, was soft and sensual, unraveling the joy, conviction, and curiosity of love.[9] The third, off of the band's 2020 studio album, Map of the Soul: 7, was very different from its predecessor, with a distinct Latin pop-esque flair and lyrics that reflected on the different sides of himself that Jimin shows to the world and those around him</p>
